# Smart LPG Gas Leakage Detection & Automatic Gas Regulator Shutoff using ESP32

An IoT-based LPG gas leakage detection system that automatically shuts off the gas regulator when a leak is detected.  
The system uses an **ESP32 microcontroller**, **MQ-2 gas sensor**, **servo motor**, **LED**, and **buzzer** to detect gas leaks and prevent accidents.  


A built-in **web dashboard** allows users to monitor gas levels in real time through WiFi.

# Working Principle

1. The **MQ-2 gas sensor continuously monitors LPG gas concentration** in the environment.
2. Sensor values are read by the **ESP32 microcontroller**.
3. If gas levels exceed a predefined **threshold value**:
   - The **buzzer activates**
   - The **LED turns ON**
   - The **servo motor rotates to close the gas regulator**
4. The ESP32 web dashboard updates the system status to **DANGER**.
5. When gas levels return to normal, the system resets automatically.

# Web Dashboard

The ESP32 hosts a **local web server** that displays real-time gas sensor data.

Open the ESP32 IP address in a browser:

```
http://ESP32-IP-ADDRESS
```

Dashboard displays:

• Gas sensor value  
• System status (SAFE / DANGER)  
• Gas regulator state  
• Manual gas control buttons  

---

# API Endpoints

The ESP32 provides REST endpoints for integration with dashboards or mobile apps.

### Get Gas Data
```
/data
```

Example response:

```json
{
 "gas": 320,
 "status": "SAFE"
}
```

### Close Gas Regulator
```
/close
```

### Open Gas Regulator
```
/open
```
